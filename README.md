* I was inspired by the old Tetris, Snake and Pacman games which brings a lot of memories and nostalgia for me from my childhood. I have started working on the said games from scratch and initially found it a little bit hard to come up with an idea how to randomize the shapes of the tetrimonis. Later on, when the time is right and after a handfull of researches I have worked on a Matrix system which defines the shape of the next incoming tetrimonis.
